# 3-Tier-System
 
Role of Mobile Agents in this case:   
We have 3 nodes:  
∙ Surveillance and sensor node  
∙ Server node  
∙ Driver (Computer) node  
Surveillance and sensor node gathers information on the area from the set of sensors, surveillance
cameras, electronic traffic signs.  
Server node receives the information gathered from the surveillance and sensor nodes and starts 
processing them to find the best route for the driver.  
Driver node receives the recommendation of the best route.  
Mobile agent can be used as an intermediate between server and two clients which reads from the 
clients and writes the client message to the server and also reads from the server and sends the server 
message to the clients.
